# YaduOS-Minimal-x86-Operating-System
YaduOS is a handcrafted operating system for x86, written in C and Assembly, designed to demonstrate core kernel and hardware interaction concepts.
YaduOS â€” Minimal x86 Operating System with Paging, Multitasking, File System, and User Program Execution

Bootloader & GDT/IDT Setup â€” Custom boot stage with descriptor tables for protected mode.

Interrupt & I/O Handling â€” Low-level interrupt service routines and hardware driver interfaces.

Paging & Virtual Memory â€” Demand-based paging for process isolation and memory efficiency.

Multitasking & Task Switching â€” Preemptive context switching using a custom task scheduler.

File System Support â€” Read/write access via a basic disk driver and filesystem layer.

User Program Execution â€” Load and run user-level applications in a protected environment.

Heap & Memory Management â€” Kernel heap allocation with paging integration.

This project is aimed at exploring how real operating systems work â€” from CPU initialization to running user applications â€” while keeping the code modular and well-structured for learning and experimentation.


## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- `make`
- `nasm`
- `gcc` (cross-compiler if targeting bare metal)
- `qemu` (for running the OS)

## ðŸ›  Build Instructions
